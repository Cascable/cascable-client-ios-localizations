<p>Typically, when connecting your camera to Cascable, all you need to do is follow your camera's instructions for connecting to its app over WiFi or a wired network. However, when it's time to launch your camera's app you instead launch Cascable.</p>

<h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If you're having trouble getting Cascable connected to your camera, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure your camera is <a href="#" onclick='showPageWithIdentifier("se.cascable.client.help.supported-cameras");'>supported by Cascable</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure both your camera and Cascable are up-to-date.</li>
<li>Make sure there are no other "competing" applications running on your network, such as Canon's EOS Utility.</li>
<li>Turn your camera off, wait a few seconds, then switch it back on again.</li>
<li>Make sure your camera and iOS device are connected to the same network, or that your iOS device is connected to the camera's own WiFi network.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>If you're still having trouble getting Cascable connected to your camera, or Cascable can see your camera but has intermittent trouble connecting to it, try the following.

Third-party software can conflict with Cascable by automatically connecting to nearby cameras. Typically, when this happens Cascable will be able to see the camera but will hang when trying to connect to it. In particular:</li>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Canon EOS Utility</strong> will attempt to automatically connect to your camera if the <img class="retina" src="eos-utility.png" alt="EOS Utility"> icon is present on your Mac's menu bar or PC's task tray. Click the icon and choose <strong>Quit</strong> to exit the program.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Adobe Lightroom</strong> will attempt to automatically connect to your camera. To stop it, choose <strong>Plug-in Managerâ€¦</strong> from Lightroom's <strong>File</strong> menu and disable the <strong>Canon Tether Plugin</strong>.</li>
</ul>

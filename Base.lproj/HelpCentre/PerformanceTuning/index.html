<p>WiFi is a fickle beast, and seemingly minor things can cause huge differences in the performance levels of your camera.</p>

<div class="figure-box"><strong>Note:</strong> Some cameras have a relatively low viewfinder framerate even in perfect conditions, particularly those with high resolution viewfinder images<!--. You can see the expected performance of your camera&rsquo;s viewfinder in Cascable by looking at its <a href="">Cascable data sheet</a>-->.</div>

<p>If you&rsquo;re <!--still -->encountering problems, this page contains some useful information to help performance troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Bluetooth Can Greatly Impact Performance</h3>

<p>When communicating wirelessly, Cascable exlusively uses WiFi. Due to the close proximity of the Bluetooth and WiFi antennas in both iOS devices and in cameras, Bluetooth can cause a large amount of interference with your camera's WiFi network in some situations.</p>

<p>To ensure this isn't happening, turn off Bluetooth on both your camera and iOS device for the best performance. On the iOS device, do this in the Settings app — disabling Bluetooth in Control Center only disconnects devices; it doesn't actually turn off Bluetooth itself.</p>

<h3>For Best Performance, Use An Existing Network</h3>

<p>The WiFi chips in cameras have a considerably less powerful broadcasting capacity than a dedicated WiFi accesspoint from a reputable manufacturer.</p>

<p>In our testing, we consistently achieved roughly double the throughput between a camera and Cascable when they are both connected to an existing WiFi network compared to connecting to a WiFi network generated by the same camera.</p>

<p>Connecting your camera and iOS device to an existing network is relatively simple — simply follow the instructions in your device&rsquo;s instruction manual.</p>

<p><!--The <a href="">Cascable data sheet</a> for your camera details the various WiFi encryption schemes it supports. -->Please be aware that the underlying protocol provided by your camera is <em>not</em> encrypted, so we recommend against using an open or WEP-encrypted WiFi network if possible.</p>

<div class="figure-box"><strong>Note:</strong> Not all cameras support joining an existing WiFi network and your only option may be to connect your iOS device to a camera-generated network.</div>

<h3>Getting The Most Out Of A Camera-Generated Network</h3> 

<p>The unfortunate thing about nature is that it doesn&rsquo;t feature ubiquitous WiFi availability to connect our cameras to. In your specific circumstance you may be able to carry around a battery- (or car-) powered WiFi access point, but doing so is clunky at best. Instead, your camera can generate its own WiFi network out in the field, but as discussed above, it isn&rsquo;t very powerful.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a couple of things you can keep in mind to get the best performance from your camera&rsquo;s built-in WiFi network.</p>

<h3>WiFi Antenna Location</h3>

<p>In most cameras, the WiFi antenna is located on the top of the body, somewhere in the viewfinder housing. Make sure this area of the camera isn&rsquo;t covered or blocked by a material that negatively affects WiFi frequencies, particularly metal, dense, or wet objects.</p>

<h3>Useable WiFi Area</h3>

<p>In our testing, we&rsquo;ve found that cameras tend to have stronger WiFi signal behind them than at the front or sides.</p> 

<div class="figure-box">
	<img class="retina" src="WiFi-TopDown.png" />
	<p class="center"><em>The typical useable WiFi area of a camera-generated WiFi network.</em></p>
</div>

<p>In a completely open outside space, the usable WiFi area from our cameras typically formed the shape you see above, providing much further useable range from behind than the front or sides.</p> 

<p>This range varies from camera to camera<!--, and you can find our maximum measured useable range on the <a href="">Cascable data sheet</a> for your camera-->.<!--</p>

<p>These figures all assume a completely open area around the camera.--> Large, dense objects will negatively affect WiFi performance, as will water — remember, people are 70% water and block WiFi frequencies quite well!</p>

<p>Additionally, since the WiFi antenna is placed on the top of the camera, you&rsquo;ll get a better range level with or above the camera than you will below it.</p>

<div class="figure-box">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you start to move outside the useable WiFi area of your camera while using 
	Cascable, performance will drop considerably. If you go further, the connection will drop and Cascable 
	will warn of the unexpected disappearance of your camera. Any ongoing file copies will be cancelled.</p>
	<p>No damage at all will be done to either Cascable or your camera, though you may need to switch 
	WiFi off and on again on your camera to re-connect.</p>

<h3>Before We Start</h3>

<h3>An Important Note For Cameras With Bluetooth</h3>

<p>For newer Fujifilm cameras that have Bluetooth (such as the X-T30), it's important to note that Cascable communicates with your camera via WiFi, <b>NOT</b> Bluetooth. Start WiFi using the <b>WIRELESS COMMUNICATION</b> menu option on your camera as described later in this guide, or bind a physical button to this function.</p>

<h3>Disabling Image Resizing On Your Camera</h3>

<p>By default, Fujifilm cameras will resize all of your photos down to 3 megapixels before they're copied over WiFi. For best results with Cascable, we recommend that this setting be disabled.</p>

<ol>
    <li>To disable this setting, on your camera push <b>MENU</b> and navigate to <b>SET-UP</b>, and choose <b>CONNECTION SETTING.</b></li>
    <p class="center"> <img class="retina" src="fuji-setup-connectionsettings.png" alt="Connection Settings" style="max-width: 90%;"></p>
    <li>Next choose <b>WIRELESS SETTINGS</b> (or <b>GENERAL SETTINGS</b> on newer models) and change the <b>RESIZE IMAGE FOR SMARTPHONE</b> setting to <b>OFF</b>.</li>
    <p class="center"> <img class="retina" src="fuji-setup-wirelesssettings.png" alt="Wireless Settings" style="max-width: 90%;"></p>
    <p class="center"> <img class="retina" src="fuji-wifi-imageresize.png" alt="Resize image for smartphone" style="max-width: 90%;"></p>
</ol>

<h3>If Connection Attempts Fail</h3>

<p>If you've used your Fujifilm camera over WiFi using other apps, connection attempts from Cascable can be rejected. To solve this, when enabling WiFi on your camera press the <b>OK - CHANGE</b> button to set up a new pairing. Relaunch Cascable, and the connection should then succeed.</p>

<h3>Connecting Cascable to Your WiFi-Enabled Camera</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Press the <b>Menu</b> button on your camera and navigate to <b>SHOOTING MENU</b> section.</li>

    <li>In the <b>SHOOTING MENU</b> section, navigate to <b>WIRELESS COMMUNICATION</b> and press the <b>OK</b> button.</li>

    <li><b>Note:</b> Many Fujifilm cameras have a dedicated WiFi button, or will allow you to configure a function button to enable WiFi. Consult your camera's manual for more information.</li>

    <li>WiFi will now be enabled. Now, ensure your iOS device is connected to the same network as your camera, then launch Cascable.</li>

    <li>If Cascable is set to connect automatically, the app should find the camera after a few moments and connect to it. If not, tap the <strong>Connection Indicator</strong> at the top of the screen, then tap <strong>Connect</strong> next to the name of your camera.</li>

    <li>For the first connection, your camera needs to be <em>paired</em> with the connecting app. If this is the case, Cascable will show this dialog:</lip>

    <div class="figure-box">
	<img class="retina" src="../../common/pairing.png" alt="Pairing Dialog">
	<br/><em>Cascable&rsquo;s pairing dialog.</em>
</div>

    <li>To continue, look at your camera and press <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the pairing request from Cascable.</li>

    <li>That&rsquo;s it — you&rsquo;re connected!</li>
</ol>
